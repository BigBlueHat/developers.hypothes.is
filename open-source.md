## Contribute

[Our team] is working hard to build products and services built on [our
principles]. However, we can’t do this alone. The long term success of
[open annotation] depends on contributions from a wide array of sources.

Including yours! Here’s how you can join the effort.

### Documentation

Documentation for the [h](http://github.com/hypothesis/h) code, it's HTTP API,
and other production-related documentation is available at
[h.readthedocs.org](http://h.readthedocs.org/).

### Development

We **code** and collaborate on [GitHub]. Our primary repository is [h],
and we keep ideas in [vision].

We have long-form **discussions** on mailing list:

-   subscribe by sending any message to <dev+subscribe@list.hypothes.is>
-   [view and search the archive online]

We **chat** in [\#hypothes.is] on [freenode]. It’s a great place to meet
contributors and community members, hang out, discuss the project, and
get questions answered.

Check out [our **documentation**] for the [h] code base to learn about
what we’ve built and how to use [our public API].

### License

Hypothes.is is Open Source. We typically use the 2-Clause [BSD License]
(aka the “Simplified BSD License” or the “FreeBSD License”).
